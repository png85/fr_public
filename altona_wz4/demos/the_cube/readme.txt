fr-062: the cube.
farbrausch at the ultimate meeting 2009.

chaos did code, had the idea and built most of the scenes.
paniq wrote the music ("sopho", another recycled old track).
fiver2 made everything a lot prettier.
ryg wrote code and tweaked a bit.
kb also coded and prepared the text overlays.


you really need a fast graphics card for this. this demo burns fillrate and bandwidth
like it's going out of fashion. it also has a bunch of rather long shaders, some way too
expensive unoptimized postprocessing effects and needs vertex textures for the full
experience. you also need d3dx9_40.dll. multisampling doesn't help at all - basically
everything happens in the pixel shader - so you might as well leave it off. if it's way
too slow on your machine, pick a lower resolution. if it doesn't run at all OH COME ON IT'S
ALMOST 2010, GET A SHADER LEVEL 3 GRAPHICS CARD ALREADY! this is real time, not amateur hour.


this is the first released werkkzeug4 production. there are probably a bunch of bugs and
compatibility problems lurking in the player - sorry about that. we expect things to get
progressively better over the course of the next few releases, as usual.

this demo was done in about a week. it really is a pure coder demo, which means we didn't
have to worry about assets and content pipelines and memory management and all that stuff
for once.

PS: it's more than 8 hours to the deadline and we're almost done (and have been since yesterday
night). we may be getting old, but we're also improving! finally!
