Maxwell's equations are a set of partial differential equations that, 
together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical 
electrodynamics, classical optics, and electric circuits. These in 
turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies.

Maxwell's equations have two major variants. The "microscopic" set 
of Maxwell's equations uses total charge and total current including 
the difficult-to-calculate atomic level charges and currents in 
materials. The "macroscopic" set of Maxwell's equations defines two 
new auxiliary fields that can sidestep having to know these 'atomic' 
sized charges and currents.

Maxwell's equations are named after the Scottish physicist and 
mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, since in an early form they are 
all found in a four-part paper, "On Physical Lines of Force," which 
he published between 1861 and 1862. The mathematical form of the 
Lorentz force law also appeared in this paper.

It is often useful to write Maxwell's equations in other forms; 
these representations are still formally termed "Maxwell's equations". 
A relativistic formulation in terms of covariant field tensors is 
used in special relativity, while, in quantum mechanics, a version 
based on the electric and magnetic potentials is preferred.
